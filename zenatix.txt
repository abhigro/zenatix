Holiday data(mannually created) and weather data(average daily temperature and average daily rain from imdlib python liberary)
are used to draw better insights from the given AC_data

And Upon Analysing the AC_data following are findings

	
	A)Regarding Maximum and Minimum consumption:
		1)Upon Analysing the basic stats, it is apparent that AC_18 has maximum mean hence it is consuming maximum units.
		2)Upon Analysing the basic stats, it is apparent that AC_5 has minimum mean hence it is consuming minimum units.

	B)Regarding the pattern in the data:
		1)correlation matrix suggest AC_1 to AC_16 are fairly correlated each other and with the sum of all ACs.
		So analysing AC_sum_1 can be assume equivalent to analysis of AC_1 to AC_16.

		2)AC_17 & AC_18 are quite similar as the are not correlated with any of the ACs among AC_1 to AC_16 and neither with the AC_sum.
		Moreover, AC_17 & AC_18 are failrly related among themself.
		And AC_17 & AC_18 are failrly correlated with time too.
		Therefore,analysing AC_sum_2 can be assume equivalent to analysis of AC_1 to AC_16

		3)AC_1 to AC_16 are fairly normally distributed as theirs means & median are close enough 
		whereas AC_17 & AC_18 are fairly +vly skewed as their respective median is quite larger than their respective mean.

		4)Upon analysing correlation matrix, it is evident that most of ACs are fairly related with temperature.

		5)On plotting the data with repect to hourly frequency,following points can be concluded that
			a)AC_17 and AC_18 are of high rating and are operated in conjunction at full load for most of the time
			b)AC_17 & AC_18 runs on light load from late night(between 00:00 to 02:00 hours) to wee hours in the early morning(between 05:00 to 07:00 hours).
			
		Therefore, from this pattern it can be speculated that AC_17 & AC_18 are central ACs with high rating which run continously.
		
		6)On plotting the data with repect to hourly frequency,following points can be concluded that
			a)AC_1 to AC_16 are of low rating and normally the follow the following patterns:
				*decreasing consumption from late night to  late morning or early noon
				*increasing consumption from late morning or early noon to  late night	
				
			
			
		Therefore, from this pattern it can be speculated that AC_1 & AC_16 are room ACs with low rating.

		7)On plotting the AC_data with respect to holidays and weekdays ,against daily consumption ,following points can be concluded that:
			a)consumption of ACs are high on weekends unless or untill weekend is not on or around the holiday.
			b)consumption is low around the holidays

		8)On seasonal_decompostion & using adafuller method, following observation are pretty clear:
			a)unit consumption has stationary trend
			b)unit consumption follows daily seasonality

	C)Regarding forecasting model:
		On training and the model using tree method Light Gradient Boosting(lightgbm) provided by microsoft 
		method, it is found that is exhibiting excellent result against the test data hence it is implemented.
		
		In this method, user need to specify date, holiday, daiy average forecasted rain & temperature.
